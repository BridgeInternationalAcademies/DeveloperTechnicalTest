# Junior Developer Technical Test

## Objective

To clone this repository, read and understand the C# code and to get the application and tests running successfully. You will then be called in for an interview where we will ask you to make some improvements and add features to the application.

Don't panic! We realize that you may or may not already know C#. When you come in for an interview, you will have an expert C# developer to guide you through the technical test exercise. We're less interested in what you know and more interested in your thought process.

The .NET Core SDK contains all of the tools need to compile and run C# applications. Visual Studio Code is a code editor which can be used to write C# applications, as well as applications using many other languages.

2. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and clone this git repository using the following command:

    `git clone https://github.com/BridgeInternationalAcademies/JuniorDeveloperTechnicalTest.git`

3. Open the `JuniorDeveloperTechnicalTest` directory in Visual Studio Code by clicking on the 'File' menu, followed by 'Open Folder', now select the `JuniorDeveloperTechnicalTest` directory.

4. Open the 'Integrated Terminal' window if it isn't already open by clicking on the 'View' menu, followed by 'IntegratedTerminal'.

5. Run `dotnet build` to compile the application, followed by ...
