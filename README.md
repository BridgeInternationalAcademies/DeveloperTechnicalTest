# Junior Developer Technical Test

## Objective

To clone this repository, read and understand the C# code and to get the application and tests running successfully. You will then be called in for an interview where we will ask you to make some improvements and add features to the application.

Don't panic! We realize that you may or may not already know C#. When you come in for an interview, you will have an expert C# developer to guide you through the technical test exercise. We're less interested in what you know and more interested in your thought process.

## Getting Started

1. Follow [these](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tutorials/with-visual-studio-code) simple instructions to install the .NET Core SDK and Visual Studio Code, it also shows you how you can create and run your first C# application. The .NET Core SDK contains all of the tools need to compile and run C# applications. Visual Studio Code is a code editor which can be used to write C# applications, as well as applications using many other languages.

2. Install the [.NET Core Test Explorer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.dotnet-test-explorer) Visual Studio Code extension. This extension makes running C# tests very easy and nicely displays which of your tests are failing.

3. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and clone this git repository using the following command:

    `git clone https://github.com/BridgeInternationalAcademies/JuniorDeveloperTechnicalTest.git`

4. Open the `JuniorDeveloperTechnicalTest` directory in Visual Studio Code by clicking on the 'File' menu, followed by 'Open Folder', now select the `JuniorDeveloperTechnicalTest` directory.

5. Open the 'Integrated Terminal' window if it isn't already open by clicking on the 'View' menu, followed by 'IntegratedTerminal'.

6. Run `dotnet build` to compile the application. Check to make sure that the application compiles successfully.

7. Click on the 'Debug' menu, followed by 'Start Debugging' to start the application.

Spend some time getting to know the code.

## Learning C#

For those eager to learn, follow the [C# Quickstart Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/quick-starts/index) to learn more about the C# language and .NET Core. This guide runs entirely in the web browser, so you don't need to install anything.

## Good Luck!
